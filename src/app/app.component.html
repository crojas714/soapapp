<h1>Hey Javier,</h1>
<h3>So this is my plan. I am going to start a soap business.
I will be making soap from home.</h3>
<h3>It takes like two to three weeks for it to process
so we have time to develop the site.</h3>
<h3>We develop the site using angular, as already discussed.
We use shopify API's.</h3>
<h3>The API will handle the transactions and storage of items
using Shopifys database.</h3>
<h3>I have a propositon for you. I want to make a website
where we offer our services as developers.</h3>
<h3>We will develop custom made websites to clients.
We can use the soap website as a website we developed for a client</h3>
<h3>If it doesn't work out then we can simply use both websites
as experience to potential employers.</h3>
<h3>So the way I see it, it's a win win. Let me know
what you think?</h3>
